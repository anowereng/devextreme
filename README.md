### Customize Application Appearance
#### Change Theme


<p>The DevExtreme Angular Template uses different themes for its content and menu. Pass the theme's name to the base-theme option in the metadata.base.json and metadata.additional.json files in the src\themes folder to modify the content and menu themes. See Predefined Themes for more information.
 
```
{
    // ...,
    "baseTheme": "material.blue.light",
    // ...
}
Run npm run build-themes to rebuild themes.

```
